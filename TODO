Look into using BOOST for explicit template instantiation. See

Remove pointers to FEValues. Just create the object through initializer list.

Alot of copied code between weak and strong form. Reduce copying somehow.


Lost adjoint consistency by computing F* = F*(Uin, Ubc) instead of F*= F*(Ubc, Ubc). See comment in assemble_boundary_term_implicit.


Find the adjoint consistent boundary condition for Neumann boundary conditions for diffusion problem and convection-diffusion problem.
Basically, what is the correct formulation for the exterior gradient? Do we need some extra terms in the functional evaluation?

Look into the performance of AD for assembling the Jacobian. Might have to just use it for the flux.

Assign boundary conditions in Physics class in a generic manner

If we want a working Burgers in 2D and 3D, find out the conservative form of the equation. Or, implement split form.
