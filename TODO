Look into member variable naming for fe_values
    This one just bit me.
    In face_boundary I used the member fe_values instead of passed fe_values_face by mistake.

Find the adjoint consistent boundary condition for the diffusion problem and convection-diffusion problem

Find out why the linear solver is soooo much slower for the diffusion problems. Maybe just need pre-conditioner.

Move boundary conditions to Physics class.

Vector-valued problems
    - Figure out global solution ordering
    - Vector valued advection
    - Euler
