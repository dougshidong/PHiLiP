/// Continuous Grid Refinement Class
/** This class provides method to update the grid using a combination of continuous mesh and
  * continuous error models. Together these are used to replace the discrete error minimization 
  * problem with one that can be directly optimized globally over the entire domain. Overall, 
  * regardless of the target of the simulation (whether it is feature-based or goal-oriented), 
  * this process reduces to finding an updated target frame-field at every point in the mesh.
  * This representation determines the target element axis at that point which describe the size,
  * anisotropy and orientation of the future cells. Due to the flexibility of the DG methods,
  * a polynomial distribution can also be used to modify the range of shape functions use for
  * each cell.
  * 
  * Once the continuous target mesh representation is determined, an update is obtained by performing
  * a call to an external mesh generation software capable of conforming to these measurements. This
  * is primarily done through GMSH for isotropic all-quad remeshing using the \f$L^\infty\f$ advancing front
  * for quads method, or in the anisotropic case using the BAMG mesh generator recombined via 
  * Blossom-Quad to form a final all-quad output mesh. Tools for writing to an experimental external
  * mesh generator based on \f$L_p\f$-CVT energy minimization to produce an anisotropic all-quad mesh
  * have also been included.
  * 
  * Note: While there are some placeholder functions have been included and certain functionality support
  *       polynomial distributions, \f$p\f$ and \f$hp\f$ adaptation have not been fully implemented or tested.
