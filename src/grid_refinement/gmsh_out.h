  * GMSH is an open source 2D and 3D mesh generation software with
  * specialized functions for treatment of all-quad meshing domains
  * (E.g. \f$L^\infty\f$ advacing front methods and BlossomQuad for recombination).
  * It uses a combination of .geo files to describe the part and case setup
  * and .pos files for addittional field information (e.g. mesh size).
  * See link for more details: https://gmsh.info/
  * 
  * Note: Currently only supported in 2D
