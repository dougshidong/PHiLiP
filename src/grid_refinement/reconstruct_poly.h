  * of the error. This plays a key role in many mesh adaptation strategies used in the 
  * various grid refinement classes. It is especially important for the continuous methods
  * where the additional directional derivatives provide anisotropic information to the
  * remeshing process. After computation, the results can be extracted from the corresponding
  * derivative_value and derivative_direction fields.
