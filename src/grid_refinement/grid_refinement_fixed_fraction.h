/// Fixed-Fraction Grid Refinement Class
/** This class offers methods to perform fixed-fraction style refinement using
  * built in Deal.II refinement methods. These methods work by first flagging a
  * chosen fraction of the mesh with largest error indicator to be refined. In 
  * \f$h\f$-refinement, this is applied by splitting each cell into a set of subcells
  * (which may potentially be anisotropic). Methods for \f$p\f$-refinement are also
  * supported which locally increment the polynomial order of the discretization.
  * \f$hp\f$-refinement is not fully supported, but some placeholder functions have been
  * included to facilitate this in the future. 
  * Note: Some functionality and behaviour will vary depending on the choice of triangulation
  *       used for both the refinement step and in other parts of the code.
