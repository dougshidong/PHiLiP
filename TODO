Look into member variable naming for fe_values
    This one just bit me.
    In face_boundary I used the member fe_values instead of passed fe_values_face by mistake.

Take physics out of the DiscontinuousGalerkin class.

Move boundary conditions to Physics class.

Compute auxiliary variable $ \sigma = \nabla u $ independently.

Take numerical flux out of the DiscontinuousGalerkin class.

Adjoint consistency, output integral 2p.
